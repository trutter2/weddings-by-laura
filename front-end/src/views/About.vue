            flowers and cakes but has the tools nessacary to make your day truly
            special. Her love for weddings started before hers when she worked
            in a professional bakery during college making and hand piping cakes
            for others. Since then she has loved every part of weddings and has
            the know how and enthusiasm to make your day worry free and one to
